This thesis investigates the genomic organization, evolutionary dynamics, and functional relevance of hemotoxic, cytotoxic, and neurotoxic protein families in reptiles. A custom, context-aware gene annotation pipeline was developed to overcome limitations in existing automatic tools, enabling accurate gene structures across diverse reptilian species.

To complement the genomic annotations, we further developed a deep learning-based binary classification model to distinguish between toxic and non-toxic protein sequences. Using labeled data from UniProt, we created embeddings for each protein sequence with ProtT5, a state-of-the-art protein language model, and trained a feedforward neural network using BioTrainer, a flexible deep learning framework for biological data. This model serves not only to validate the functional coherence of our annotations but also to explore the potential of sequence-based classification in venom research. Through this integrated approach—comprising contextual gene annotation, evolutionary comparison, and deep learning based analysis—we provide a comprehensive framework for the study of hemotoxic proteins in reptiles. This thesis is part of a collaborative research project conducted jointly by three students, each focusing on a distinct venom phenotype—cytotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hemotoxicity. While certain models, figures, and datasets were developed collectively, each thesis emphasizes a specific functional class and provides an independent interpretation and analysis.
